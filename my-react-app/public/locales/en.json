Ved hjælp af OpenAI's API og prompt engineering skabte vi forskellige betingelser for at undersøge, hvordan disse påvirker brugerens tillid til AI-systemet. Den centrale tanke bag eksperimentet var,  at hvis systemer hjælper brugeren med at kalibrere deres tillid – så de hverken overvurderer eller undervurderer systemets evner – kan AI forhåbentligt anvendes mere effektivt og sikkert."
